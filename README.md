# Predicting new cases of COVID-19 using Time Series Analysis
Project Status: In progress

## Abstract
The end of COVID-19 guarantees tremendous opportunities in various fields, including businesses and employment; local restaurants could re-open, and temporarily laid-off airline employees could return to their workplace. According to Statista, about 413 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines had been produced up to March 2021, and China, U.S. EU, India, and U.K. are the top five countries that had produced 96% of all doses. However, these countries strictly control exportation of the vaccines for protecting their national economy. When the five countries no longer have new cases of COVID-19, the vaccines are expected to be commonly available around the world, and the pandemic is likely to end. This project applies Predictive Analytics and Time-Series Analysis, using auto.arima function in R, to predict and visualize a timeline for the end of the pandemic by determining when the COVID-19 trend stops in the five countries.
